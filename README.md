OpenHexa
========

An HTML5 browsing interface utilizing iframes.

Hi there! Welcome to Dwitek's Open Source project: "OpenHexa".
To open the program you must download the latest release, Extract it in to it's own folder, and open tantra3.html with a browser.
I personally recommend you use a webkit browser (Safari, Chrome, Chromium, etc), but the Gecko engine works too (Firefox, etc).
